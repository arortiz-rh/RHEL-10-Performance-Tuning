# RHEL-10-Performance-Tuning
This project aims to improve the performance of RHEL 10 using image mode an bootable containers

Hardware used for this project includes Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB) and the UP Squared 7100 Edge (8GB). Both of these allow me to have tested 64 bit ARM and Intel 64 bit CPUs, and container files with directions on how to build and use them will be included at a later point in time.
